## Project Overview

Maggie AI Assistant is an advanced, voice-activated artificial intelligence framework implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture with event-driven state transitions and modular utility capabilities. The system is specifically optimized for high-performance computing environments, particularly those utilizing AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPUs and NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPUs, enabling efficient local language model inference, speech processing, and interactive voice response.

The project emphasizes local processing with minimal cloud dependencies, ensuring privacy and offline functionality while leveraging consumer hardware to deliver sophisticated AI capabilities. By utilizing advanced software optimization techniques including mixed-precision computation, efficient threading, and dynamic resource management, Maggie achieves performance levels that were previously only possible with cloud-based systems.

### Core Technical Architecture

* **State-Machine Design**: Implements a deterministic FSM with five carefully designed states (IDLE, READY, ACTIVE, CLEANUP, SHUTDOWN) that manage system resources efficiently
* **Event-Driven Communication**: Uses a centralized event bus with publisher-subscriber pattern for decoupled component interactions
* **Hardware-Aware Optimization**: Automatically detects and configures for system capabilities, with specialized optimizations for Ryzen 9 5900X and RTX 3080
* **Thread Pool Management**: Implements optimized worker thread allocation (8 threads for Ryzen 9 5900X) for maximum throughput without system interference

### Core Features

#### 1. Wake Word Detection with Minimal CPU Usage

### Basic Interaction Flow

#### 1. Wake Up Maggie

* **User Action**: Say "Maggie" clearly at a moderate volume
* **System Process**:
  1. Wake word detector identifies the keyword with Porcupine engine
  2. System transitions from IDLE to READY state
  3. Core components initialize:
     * Speech processor activates
     * LLM model is loaded into GPU memory (32 layers on RTX 3080)
     * TTS engine initializes
  4. System transitions to READY state when initialization completes
* **System Response**: 
  * Audio feedback: "Ready for your command"
  * Visual feedback: GUI status changes from "IDLE" (light gray) to "READY" (light green)
  * Backend change: Inactivity timer starts (5 minutes by default)
* **Technical Details**:
  * Wake word detection operates at ~1% CPU usage while idle
  * Transition process takes approximately 2-5 seconds depending on model loading speed
  * LLM loads with optimized parameters for RTX 3080 (float16 precision, 32 GPU layers)

#### 2. Create a Recipe

* **User Action**: Say "New recipe" clearly
* **System Process**:
  1. Speech recognition captures and processes command using Whisper
  2. System transitions from READY to ACTIVE state
  3. Recipe Creator utility initializes in a dedicated thread
  4. Multi-stage workflow begins:
  
     **Stage 1: Recipe Name**
     * System: "What would you like to name this recipe?"
     * User: Provide name (e.g., "Chocolate Chip Cookies")
     * System: "I heard Chocolate Chip Cookies. Is that correct?"
     * User: Confirm with "Yes" or "Correct" (or reject with "No" or "Wrong")
  
     **Stage 2: Recipe Description**
     * System: "Please describe the recipe, including ingredients and steps."
     * User: Provide complete recipe details, speaking clearly and using structured sentences
       ```
       "For these chocolate chip cookies, you'll need two cups of all-purpose flour, 
       one teaspoon of baking soda, half teaspoon of salt, three quarters cup of 
       unsalted butter, three quarters cup of brown sugar, half cup of white sugar, 
       one egg, one teaspoon of vanilla extract, and two cups of chocolate chips.
       
       First, preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. In a small bowl, mix flour, 
       baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy.
       Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually add dry ingredients. Stir in chocolate chips.
       Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes
       until golden brown. Cool on wire racks."
       ```
     * System processes input for approximately 30 seconds
  
     **Stage 3: Document Creation**
     * System extracts structured data using LLM processing
     * Creates formatted document with proper sections
     * Saves file to recipes folder with timestamp (e.g., "Chocolate_Chip_Cookies_1716249871.docx")
  
* **System Response**:
  * Audio feedback: "Recipe 'Chocolate Chip Cookies' has been created and saved."
  * Visual feedback: 
    * GUI state transitions back to "READY"
    * Event log shows completion message
  * File system change: New document appears in recipes/ directory
* **Technical Details**:
  * Audio recording uses 16-bit 22050Hz sampling
  * LLM processing leverages 4-bit quantized Mistral 7B model
  * Document creation uses python-docx template system
  * Total process time: approximately 45-90 seconds depending on recipe complexity

#### 3. Put Maggie to Sleep

* **User Action**: Say "Sleep" or "Go to sleep"
* **System Process**:
  1. Speech recognition processes command
  2. System transitions from READY to CLEANUP state
  3. Resource release operations:
     * Inactivity timer is cancelled
     * Speech recognition system stops
     * LLM model is unloaded from GPU memory
     * TTS engine resources are released
  4. System transitions to IDLE state
* **System Response**:
  * Audio feedback: "Going to sleep"
  * Visual feedback: GUI status changes to "IDLE" (light gray)
  * System resource change: GPU memory usage drops significantly (~7GB freed)
* **Technical Details**:
  * CLEANUP state handles graceful resource deallocation
  * Only wake word detection remains active (minimal CPU usage)
  * System can be reawakened by saying "Maggie" again

#### 4. Shut Down Maggie

* **User Action**: Say "Shutdown" or "Turn off" (or click Shutdown button in GUI)
* **System Process**:
  1. Command triggers immediate transition to CLEANUP state
  2. All resources are released:
     * Wake word detector stopped
     * All thread pools terminated
     * GPU memory completely freed
     * File handles closed
  3. System transitions to SHUTDOWN state
  4. Application exits
* **System Response**:
  * Audio feedback: "Shutting down"
  * Visual feedback: GUI status briefly shows "SHUTDOWN" (red) before application closes
  * Process termination: All Maggie processes end cleanly
* **Technical Details**:
  * Ensures complete resource cleanup with explicit shutdown operations
  * Prevents memory leaks and orphaned processes
  * Can be automated via system service or scheduled task

3. **Register Utility in MaggieCore**:
   ```python
   def _initialize_utilities(self):
       """Initialize utility modules based on configuration."""
       utilities_config = self.config.get("utilities", {})
       
       # Load recipe creator if configured
       if "recipe_creator" in utilities_config:
           from utils.recipe_creator import RecipeCreator
           self.utilities["recipe_creator"] = RecipeCreator(
               self.event_bus, 
               utilities_config["recipe_creator"]
           )
           
       # Load custom utility if configured
       if "my_custom_utility" in utilities_config:
           from utils.my_custom_utility import MyCustomUtility
           self.utilities["my_custom_utility"] = MyCustomUtility(
               self.event_bus, 
               utilities_config["my_custom_utility"]
           )
   ```

### Event-Driven Communication

Communication between components uses the event bus, following these principles:

1. **Event Publication**:
   ```python
   # Publish an event with data and optional priority
   self.event_bus.publish("event_type", data, priority=0)
   ```

2. **Event Subscription**:
   ```python
   # Subscribe to an event type with optional priority
   self.event_bus.subscribe("event_type", self._handle_event, priority=0)
   ```

3. **Event Handler Implementation**:
   ```python
   def _handle_event(self, data):
       """
       Handle an event from the event bus.
       
       Parameters
       ----------
       data : Any
           Event data payload
       """
       # Event handling logic
       pass
   ```

4. **Common Event Types**:
   * `"wake_word_detected"`: Wake word detected
   * `"command_detected"`: Speech command recognized
   * `"state_changed"`: FSM state transition
   * `"utility_completed"`: Utility finished execution
   * `"utility_error"`: Error in utility execution

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

When developing extensions for Maggie, follow these optimization guidelines:

1. **Thread Management**:
   * Use the thread pool for background tasks
   * Limit concurrent threads to 8 for Ryzen 9 5900X
   * Make threads daemon to ensure proper cleanup
   * Use thread names for easier debugging

2. **GPU Optimization**:
   * Use float16 precision for Tensor Core acceleration
   * Implement automatic fallback to CPU for memory pressure
   * Explicitly manage CUDA memory when possible
   * Use batched processing when appropriate

3. **Memory Management**:
   * Implement dynamic resource loading/unloading
   * Use caching for frequently accessed data
   * Monitor memory usage with explicit thresholds
   * Release resources promptly when not needed

4. **Audio Processing**:
   * Use native audio APIs for low latency
   * Implement audio preprocessing for improved recognition
   * Consider caching for repetitive audio synthesis
   * Adjust sampling parameters based on CPU load

5. **State Management**:
   * Implement clean state transitions
   * Handle edge cases for interrupted flows
   * Provide clear user feedback during transitions
   * Use timeouts to prevent hanging states

### Debugging and Logging

Maggie uses the Loguru library for comprehensive logging:

1. **Log Levels**:
   * DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic information
   * INFO: General operational information
   * WARNING: Potential issues that don't prevent operation
   * ERROR: Errors that prevent specific operations
   * CRITICAL: Critical errors that may crash the application

2. **Logging Best Practices**:
   ```python
   from loguru import logger
   
   # Log at appropriate levels
   logger.debug("Detailed diagnostic information")
   logger.info("General operational information")
   logger.warning("Potential issue detected")
   logger.error(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")
   logger.critical("Critical failure")
   
   # Use structured logging with context
   logger.bind(utility="my_custom_utility").info("Utility-specific log")
   
   # Log exceptions with traceback
   try:
       # Code that might raise an exception
       pass
   except Exception as e:
       logger.exception(f"Exception details: {e}")
   ```

3. **Log File Management**:
   * Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory
   * Files rotate at 10MB with 1-week retention
   * Console logs show INFO level by default
   * File logs capture DEBUG level for detailed diagnostics

4. **Debugging Tools**:
   * Use `python main.py --debug` to enable detailed logging
   * Use `python main.py --verify` to check system configuration
   * Check the Error Log tab in the GUI for issues
   * Review log files in logs/ directory for persistent issues

5. **Performance Profiling**:
   * Monitor CPU usage with Task Manager or htop
   * Check GPU memory usage with nvidia-smi
   * Use timestamps in logs to identify bottlenecks
   * Look for memory leaks with tools like memory_profiler

By following these guidelines, you can create powerful extensions to Maggie that maintain the system's performance characteristics and integrate seamlessly with its architecture.
