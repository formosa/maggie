"""
Maggie AI Assistant Core Application Module
==========================================

This module defines the core application class `MaggieAI` which serves as the central 
controller implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture with event-driven 
state transitions.

The MaggieAI class manages the initialization, state transitions, and lifecycle 
of the assistant components including speech recognition, language model processing,
text-to-speech synthesis, and extension modules.

The architecture follows a publish-subscribe pattern using an event bus for 
decoupled communication between components. Each component can react to state 
changes or other events without direct dependencies on other components.

The application is specifically optimized for AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and NVIDIA RTX 3080
hardware, with resource management and optimization systems tailored to these
components.

class MaggieAI(EventEmitter, EventListener):
    """
    Core application class implementing a Finite State Machine for the Maggie AI Assistant.
    
    This class serves as the primary controller for the entire system, managing the
    initialization, configuration, and lifecycle of all components. It also 
    coordinates the interactions between components using an event-driven architecture
    and a state machine design pattern.
    
    The MaggieAI class inherits from both EventEmitter and EventListener, allowing it
    to both publish events to and subscribe to events from the central event bus. This
    enables decoupled communication between components through a publish-subscribe pattern.
    
    Key responsibilities include:
    
    1. System initialization and configuration
    2. State management and state transitions
    3. Component lifecycle management
    4. Extension loading and management
    5. Resource optimization
    6. Event processing
    
    The state machine implementation follows the State design pattern [1]_ with a predefined
    set of states (INIT, STARTUP, IDLE, LOADING, READY, ACTIVE, BUSY, CLEANUP, SHUTDOWN)
    and transitions between these states. State-specific behavior is encapsulated in
    state handler methods, which are registered with the state manager during initialization.
    
    The event-driven architecture enables loose coupling between components, allowing
    the system to be more modular and extensible. Components can react to events without
    direct dependencies on other components.

    config_path : str, optional
        Path to the configuration file, by default 'config.yaml'

    Notes
    -----
    This class implements a hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM) architecture [2]_,
    which provides a robust framework for modeling complex system behavior through
    state transitions. The system's behavior is determined by its current state,
    and transitions between states are triggered by events or explicit commands.
    
    The event-driven architecture [3]_ complements the state machine by providing
    a mechanism for components to communicate without direct dependencies.

        This method associates methods of this class with specific states and

        or when a transition occurs, the corresponding handler method will be
        called.
        
        The state handlers follow a naming convention:
        - `_on_enter_<state>`: Called when entering a state

        This implementation of the State pattern differs from the classic GoF pattern
        by using a central state manager with registered callbacks rather than 
        polymorphic state objects. This approach reduces the number of classes needed
